                            In order to improve some of the analog systems in
                            Keystone, I built an app that streamlined the
                            weekend checkin and checkout procedure.

                        <p>Due to the size and scope of the Keystone faculty, communication proves to be a difficult system. Building this hub has allowed more departments to create effective communication with the staff.</p>

                        <p>Continue to develop communication systems to make the community more in touch with each other. Student hub, committee pages, department portals are all examples of work that I have planned.</p>
                    <p>Connect the data that teachers are generating each day to the places where it can be used to inform decisions. Assignments, ATLs, Summatives are some of the connections that I have made between PowerSchool/Managebac/Microsoft.</p>
                    <p>Working with small groups to both develop future tools and use those tools to inform classroom planning and instruction.</p>

                            <li>Extend the communication hub into a whole school tool. Students need a way to connect the many activities and events that they are creating. They also want archives of the previous years extended essays, personal projects, and capstone projects.</li>
                            <li>
                                Take the code from the landing pages, and bring it over to SharePoint. There are lots of uses that have been suggested to me such as a way to connect planning groups to the number of summatives in a cycle and a way for teachers to self-select lessons for observations.</li>
